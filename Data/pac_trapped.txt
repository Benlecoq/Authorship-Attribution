You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusionHappiness, living on the streets is a delusionEven a smooth criminal one day must get caughtShot up or shot down with the bullet that he boughtNine millimeter kickin' thinking about what the streets do to meCause they never talk peace in the black communityAll we know is violence, do the job in silenceWalk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrantsToo many brothers daily heading for the big pennNiggas commin' out worse offthan when they went inOver the years I done alot of growin' upGetten drunk thrown' upCuffed upThen I said I had enoughThere must be another route, way outTo money and fame, I changed my nameAnd played a different gameTired of being trapped in this vicious cycleIf one more cop harrasses me I just might go psychoAnd when I get 'em, I'll hit 'em with the bum rushOnly a lunatic would like to see his skull crushedYo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the uziThey got me trapped....They got me trappedCan barely walk the city streetsWithout a cop harrassing me, searching meThen asking my identityHands up, throw me up against the wallDidn't do a thing at allI'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fallCuffed up throw me on the concreteCoppers try to kill meBut they didn't know this was the wrong streetBang bang, count another casualtyBut it's a cop whose shop is brutalityWho do you blame? It's a shame because the man's slainHe got caught in the chains of his own gameHow can I feel guilty after all the things they did to meSweated me, hunted meTrapped in my own communityOne day I'm gonna bustBlow up on this societyWhy did ya lie to me?I couldn't find a trace of equalityWork me like a slave while they laid backHomie don't play thatIt's time I let 'em suffer the paybackI'm tryin to avoid physical contactI can't hold back, it's time to attack jackThey got me trappedNow I'm trapped and want to find a getawayAll I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stayCan't use the phone Cause I'm sure someone is tappin inDid it beforeAin't scared to use my gat againI look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevantBut now he's the devils friendToo late to be tellin' himHe shot first and i'll be damned if I run awayHomie is done away I should of put my gun awayI wasn't thinkin' all I heard was the ridiculeGirlies was laughin', Tup sayin "Damn homies is dissin you"I fired my weaponStarted steppin' in the hurricaneI got shot so I droppedFeelin' a burst of painGot to my feetCouldn't see nothin' but bloody bloodNow I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murdererRan through an alleyStill lookin' for my getawayCoppers said Freeze, or you'll be dead todayTrapped in a cornerDark and I couldn't see the lightThoughts in my mind was the nine and a better lifeWhat do I do? Live my life in a prison cellI'd rather die than be trapped in a living hellThey got me trapped
