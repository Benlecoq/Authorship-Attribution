And I'm still a beast with these flowsFeeling real low my tree self esteem rollWe drowning out Atlantis can't overflow beast coastBe more specific next time you shoutin' out a-mi-goI am not the star? In fact I'm planet aweFuck what the media write, bitch this is a fire barPlease don't leave your comment if you are not up to parNo names, putting you in a verse that's too farYour mundane can't obtain, the knowledge of my brainMy set told me light you up so this that propaneIt's Nathan all I gotta do is just spit a flameNo escaping, you in a swimming pool of champagneYou set yourself up for that one maneThe king of New York?Ha! we ain't just gon' let that one hangLast nigga got dethroned and you ain't from my zoneThe rest of the real niggas is dead and goneI'm getting a ugh, I'm getting a ughFrom the weak shit that I hearNo lyrical style come near meHow they gon' try to compare meTo what's clearly, barely, not nearly as rare as meSwank make hands fold like a rare diseaseI got arthritis yo it's scaring meI got all these rap niggas fucking fearing meHeard they was looking for war but ain't declaring meI'm well aware, NY not DelawareI'm the real king fella hereYou more like Prince of Bel-AirI'm clearing the air, might fire at willThese rap niggas don't want the static for realCuz they lines not adjacent to my spectacular skillIf you don't fuck with cinematic stand stillMy life's a movie on the realYou can get shot with your hands on the wheelWith your pants at ya heels
