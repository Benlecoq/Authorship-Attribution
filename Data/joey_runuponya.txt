Bend that shit backwardsHit one backwood, crack the pussy like a passwordBet that pussy's last word is masterAsk her, roll my rocker til I made that astronautThat's NASA thought, be that young fly, nasty oneSwallow the seeds, please, but you can't catch me slipping, honFirst thing's first, I, JoeyFreaks all the honeys, mommies, the playboy bunniesThe hoes love me, get down before the moneyJust know shit could get ugly, but whether it rain or sunnyJust never worry, chinchillas in FebruaryVanilla, that's when you readyCheck the itinerary whenever it's necessaryKeep my baby straight, peep my lady laceThe Margiela to DonevaFool less it's planned and everything is in controlSo hit the gas and let's goIt's no sleep til Brooklyn, another beastie boyAnd she just can't stop looking, she like it rawReal spitter and all and that's the word of mouthAnd let her sit in the jawI'm so nasty, please just walk past meSo tempted to grab it, I gotta have itWe could be living lavish so tell me, girl, right awayWe could hit the bank then escape to the hideawayIs you riding, riding with me?Is you riding?Is you riding, riding with me?Is you riding?
