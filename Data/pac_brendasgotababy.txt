I hear Brenda's got a babyWell, Brenda's barely got a brainA damn shameTha girl can hardly spell her nameWell let me show ya how it affects the whole communityNow Brenda never really knew her momsand her dad was a junky puttin death into his armIt's sad, cause I bet Brenda doesn't even knowJust cause your in the ghetto doesn't mean ya can't growBut oh, that's a thought, my own revelationDo whatever it takes to resist the temptationBrenda got herself a boyfriendHer boyfriend was her cousin, now lets watch the joy endShe tried to hide her pregnancy, from her familyWho didn't really care to see, or give a damn if sheWent out and had a church of kidsAs long as when tha check came they got first dibsNow Brendas belly is gettin biggerBut no one seems ta notice any change in her figureShe's 12 years old and she's having a babyIn love with a molester who's sexing her crazyAnd yet she thinks that he'll be with her foreverAnd dreams of a world with tha two of them are together, whateverHe left her and she had tha baby soloShe had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know soShe didn't know, what ta throw away and what to keepShe wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heepI guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the criesShe didn't realize how much tha the little baby had her eyesNow tha babys in the trash heep ballingMomma can't help her, but it hurts to hear her callingBrenda wants ta run away, momma say, you makin' me lose payThe social workers here everydayNow Brenda's gotta make her own wayCan't go to her family, they won't let her stayNo money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a jobShe tried ta sell crack, but end up getting robbedSo now what's next, there ain't nothin left ta sellSo she sees sex as a way of leavin hellIt's payin tha rent, so she really can't complainProstitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby
