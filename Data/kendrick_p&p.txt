Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairsSomething to inspire me, rather than society'swoes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit loveI want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's ClubI used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05That bitch was racist, got me fired, they rushed us then, I had no jobPushing in my mama van, stop for gas on RosecransTrust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably didGuilty by association, story of my life nigga~!You gon' make me flip, then split yo' shit, judge give me life nigga~!Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louie's BurgersHold my tears, I tried my best, let it go, trench my pulloverCycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-marginMaintaining my modest-modest as I dreamSo while I go through all-this-all-this, bullshit what you call itLife itself, I know it helps, let me scroll through my BlackberryI said, keep reading my diary when my life's entirelysurrounded by the irony of living in the cityI said they wouldn't hire me, I said I got my ass beatand the only thing can help is ass and some tittiesSo what's up baby? I said what's up?I had a long day and I really wanna fuckSee I ain't tryna think about no phone bills, credit card late feesCapital One popping up on my caller I.D.Pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow tip shotsWatching my vehicle break down on another man's blockMan, that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear?You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gearsOr run through a pothole at two in the morningScared to hit your emergencies, cause then they'll be on itSee I know, when the harsh reality takes tollOpen up your contacts, then scroll ("hey what's up daddy?")
