I woke up this morning and figured I'd call youIn case I'm not here tomorrow, I'm hopin' that I can borrowa peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really importantMy mind is really distorted, I find nothin' but trouble in my lifeI'm fortunate you believe in a dreamThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routineAnd last night was just another distraction or a reactionof what we consider madness, I know exactly what happenedYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for helpHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feellike everything was alright and a fight he tried to put upBut the type of bullet that stuck had went against his willAs blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictiveEverybody's a victim in my eyesWhen I ride it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch blackA demon glued to my back whispering "Get 'em!"I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuckThat same mentality that told my brother not to duckIn actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colorsI wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recoverThe life that I knew as a young'n in pajamas and Dun-ta-dunsWhen thunder comes, it rains cats and dogsDumb niggas like me never prosperPrognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well devotedThis Piru shit been in me foreverSo forever I'ma push it, wherever, wheneverAnd I love you cause you love my brother like you didJust promise me you'll tell this story when you make it bigAnd if I die before your album drop, I hopeYou wrote a song about my sister on your tapeAnd called it "Section.80," the message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby"What's crazy was I was hearin about itBut doubted your ignorance, how could you ever just put her on blast and shit?Judgin' her past and shit?Well it's completely my future, her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shitAnd I'ma need that 40 dollarsEven if I gotta fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lotGonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of threeMy titties bounce on the cadence of his tinglin' keysMatter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E'sHe got a cousin named David and I seen him last weekThis is the life of another girl damaged by the systemThese foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'emSee my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em backto where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denimof a family gene that show women how to be womanOr better yet a leader, you need her to learn somethingThen you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taughtThree niggas in one room, first time I was tossedAnd I'm exhausted but fuck that "sorry for your loss" shitMy sister died in vain, but what point are you tryin' to gainIf you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I'll wait.. Your rebuttal a little too lateAnd if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the songCause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my ownAnd matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straightI'll probably live longer than you and never fade awayI'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fateAnd I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get or die tryin'I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'You lyin' to these motherfuckers, talkin' about you can help 'emWith my story, you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, niggaDon't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myselfAm I really scared of passing away? It it's today I hope I hear acry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demonWith the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of JesusI wrote some raps that make sure that my lifelinerake in the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiancewith the other side may come soon and if I'm doomedMay the wound help my mother be blessed for many moonsI suffer a lot and every day the glass mirrorGet tougher to watch, I tie my stomach in knotsAnd I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with deathMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threatsthat can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerfulAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouchMaybe cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of deathReally stuck in the scheme of wonderin' when I'ma restAnd you're right, your brother was a brother to meAnd your sister's situation was the one that pulled mein a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screenBy any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come betweenHer personal life, I was like "It need to be told"Cursin' the life of 20 generations after her soulExactly what'd happen if I ain't continued rappin'Or steady being distracted by money, drugs, and fourFives, I count lives all on these songsLook at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strongFightin' for your rights, even when you're wrongAnd hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm goneNow am I worth it? ..Did I put enough work in? ..
