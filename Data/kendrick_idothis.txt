Uh, I used to to wanna by like Michael JordanFigured that I'd hit the NBA and make a fortuneThank God for these rap recordingsI can ball like him on every verse and chorus5-0-1s, Louis letterman jacketLittle brother only five, momma put him on my taxesYou know that Compton ghetto shitthat every Section 8 tenant is familiar with? Ooh weeThey say he something like the seventies, but I'm from '87With a thousand dimes, you got eighty sevensGourmet sneakers, hair nappyFucking all my high school teachers, that was '05 broAnd I don't like 'em if the ass thinAnd I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friendThe fuck I look like?A billion bucks, and that's whyShe looking at the car like she wanna fuck itShe looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck itHating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck itShe say she on birth control, no I don't trust it, hoeUh, so give me fifty feet champRun until I got a bunion and my feet crampI'm in the hot spot, I know they seats dampAnd I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stampYou Nix Check CashingI'm GT crashing, 1-0-5 off rampAy, that lil' nigga got it going onG5, going-going-going goneCloud nine mind stateI drop a record, then I raise the crime rateKilling this shit, where's your funeral tie?A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck, skip to Y
