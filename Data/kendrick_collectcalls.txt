Momma take this motherfuckin block offTryna reach you every day, collect callsNever get through when I go through withdrawalsSay who told you that I wanted this doorto slam shut, I just wanted to vent orask you if you can give me your rent fora attorney, I can pay you back moreSoon as I get out, yeah every rack is yoursCommissary runnin low, I need helpNot too much, I hustle up the rest myselfK-Dot wrote me sayin Marcus got killedIf you know me then you know how bad I feelKeisha prove me wrong and never came to visitAnd I heard she fuckin on some other niggaAnd my niggaz left me in the dark, blindMomma just get back at me this last timeMomma take this motherfuckin block offWhat's on the date one day I take the block offPulled up and they put me in them cop carsPlease believe me, this ain't easy by farYou forgot you're talkin to your only son'Member when you put me in that relay run?I was racin, chasin dreams to be the bestYou had taught me that the very day I wonAll I need is you to give me same supportInvestigation sayin that the same reportfrom a witness just might testify in courtD.A. say I take a deal or take a lossI ain't built for all them God damn numbersGod's will, say a prayer for me mommaIf you can't then open up the phone linesMomma just get back at me this last timeDante, if I stress to take the block offThat's the day the state had take them locks offI can only help but do so muchBetterin yourself, your own crutchLook at your reflection, tell me who you seeWho is your protection? G-O-DNo it's not neglection, I have just acceptedyour fate and what it's gon' be'Member all the nights that I criedthinking that my only son just died?Peeking through the window, kicking through the doorIt's you they looking for, raid outsideRather see you locked up than deadOnly you would say that I'm selfishSo before I take the stand and put this bible in my handSon, let me say this
