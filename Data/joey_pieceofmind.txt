What life like now, tryna figure outThey put this mic on trial cause he be killin' nowForever bitin' my forbidden styleLaying low for a minute in the gameSince I came all these niggas lookin' timidMy life can never dimeth, the Lord is my sheppardJesus woke a devil in him, the sinnin' with least effortThinking back to those lefferts daysAnd I ain't been the same since I left 6th gradeMy mind's strayin', you think I had the biggest heartTaking walks with abuela in the park just to tell herI'ma grow propellers one day and be a good fellaPlay the hero or whoever, the hood gon' tell usLet's just pray it ain't the villainTell 'em I be feeling some wayThinkin' I can get the Maybach off gun playInstead I let the words play with 90 beats a minuteBet the streets lose a heart beat before the verse finishBut life goes on, basic rules still applyAnd you can feel that lot in any hood that you live byFrom Flatbush, to Figg side, I was a school boy tooHoppin' trains, I just missed my cueAnd what's life like now, I can't figure outThey put my mans on trial, say he a killer nowConspiracies, we gon' get you outJust keep ya head up G, shit is wildIt's bugged out cause I know you tryna see your childBut I'ma hold you down still cause you my brotherI just gave Will a lil' somethin' for your baby motherBut don't stress, know you caught up in the b.sBut next time you see us, we gonna be our bestLove you my nigga, word is bond, you'll stay strongOut in New York this same shit is goin' onPeace to all my brothers who keep still holdin' onBeen away so long, feel like a tickin' time bombThey make judgement to my kind, who the odds is againstPut our backs on the fence, so we self defenceFollowed by a series of unfortunate eventsLooking like white America got a brother again
