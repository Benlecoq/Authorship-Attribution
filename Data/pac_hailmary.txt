I ain't a killer but don't push meRevenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin pussyPicture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein quotedPeeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed itBow down, pray to God hoping that he's listeninSeein niggaz comin for me, to my diamonds, when they glisteninNow pay attention, rest in peace fatherI'm a ghost in these killin fieldsHail Mary catch me if I go, let's go deep insidethe solitary mind of a madman who screams in the darkEvil lurks, enemies, see me fleeActivate my hate, let it break, to the flameSet trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aimSome say the game is all corrupted, fucked in this shitStuck, niggaz is lucky if we bust out this shit, plusmama told me never stop until I bust a nutFuck the world if they can't adjustIt's just as well, Hail MaryPenetentiaries is packed with promise makersNever realize the precious time the bitch niggaz is wastinInstutionalized I lived my life a product made to crumbleBut too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble, we ballinCatch me father please, cause I'm fallin, in the liquor storeThat's the Hennessee I hear ya callin, can I get some more?Hail til I reach Hell, I ain't scaredMama checkin in my bedroom; I ain't thereI got a head with no screws in it, what can I doOne life to live but I got nuttin to lose, just me and youon a one way trip to prison, sellin drugsWe all wrapped up in this livin, life as ThugsTo my homeboys in Quentin Max, doin they bidRaise hell to this real shit, and feel thisWhen they turn out the lights, I'll be down in the darkThuggin eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary nigga
