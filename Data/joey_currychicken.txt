First things first is I been rehearsing these versesIn hopes that I hit the surface and keep myself afloatBut I know one day I'm earning me some platinum and some goldAnd all them labels could just reimburse this dick in they throatAnd tell my mama "Oh no," your purses will never run lowNo more cause back when I was four, and we was poorYou would purchase the storeSo here I go, your little man has got to growI'm walking out the doorMy mama just be smiling, cause she knowI got my back and got her worriedOnly thing she ask is that I hurryHome in time for Christmas for some dinnerSeen you on TV again, boy you lookin' thinnerBut you lookin' like a winner, ayeWorst thing worse, I could've been stealing your purseOr just been, putting in work and leaving niggas in the dirtBut ever since birth I knew I would be something on this EarthSo now I spit that dope, that shit be hittin' ya nerveAnd to my Papa my word is my bondWhen you held me in your armsDid you know along that a star was born?Then you named me Jo-Vaughn, now that name ring alarmsNearly 20 years later we on a plane to The Palms
