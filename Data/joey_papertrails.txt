Sitting back plotting, jotting information on my nationReally started from the bottom, boy, cottonBut they still planting plantations, we keep buying inClosed-minded men, pride is higher than the prices on your pradasBalenciagas, balance my soccer with the henny aguaMe and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanadaThe flow like plenty lavaWith just a penny I could multiply my worthAnd make you work for me for twenty hoursI swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listeningThis kid ain't been the same since Biggie smacked me at my christeningWatch your tradition and please play it safeCause your position on the top is switching right in front your faceRocking on this bass with rhymes, I'm bustin' outHe duckin' down, got some issues now, headed for your houseSo put the pistols down, got that red dot on your noseWho put the clown on lock, jaws like the blue knowsFroze, keep your mouth closed or you can see the solarI got connections that guaranteed to see closed doorsYou hear that underground sonarThe way I flows, this wisdomThe Pros been on a missionListen into the chamber, get hyperbolicThey raisin' max, I raise stakes to keep the brolicMy bitches is macrocosmic, pass the chronicThe mastered sonics is lightyears above your consciousYou're novice, but I got notes that strike nervesI promise your minds ain't sharp like my swordsSo cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans isAnd PS: Your bitch a genius, learnt from my penisI got dreams filling arenas and breaking bracketsTend this racket, while I'm cracking a SerenaGod damn, God bless the heaven that sent youBut now I'm breezing out, baby, cause my rent's due
