Look inside these walls and you see them havin' withdrawalsof a prisoner on his wayTrapped inside your desire to fire bullets that strayTrack attire just tell you I'm tired and ran awayI should ask a choir what do you require to sing a song that acquire me to have faithAs the record spin I should prayFor the record I recognize that I'm easily prey, I got ate alive yesterdayI got animosity building, it's probably big as a buildingMe jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safeBut what am I supposed to do when the topic is red or blueand you understand that I ain't but know I'm accustomed to?Just a couple that look for trouble and live in the street with rankNo better picture to paint than me walking from bible studyAnd called his homies because he had said he noticed my faceFrom a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bangStep on my neck and get blood on your Nike checksI don't mind because one day you'll respect, the +good kid, m.A.A.d. city+All I see is strobe lights, blinding me in my hindsightFindin' me by myself, promise me you can help In all honesty I got time to be copacetic untilYou had finally made decision to hold me against my willIt was like a head on collision that folded me standin' stillI can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the billEvery time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to killAll my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere as a better personI know you heard this and probably in fearBut what am I supposed to do when the blinkin' of red and blueflash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof?And you ask "Lift up your shirt" cause you wonder if a tattooof affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me throughgang files but that don't matter because the matter is racial profileI heard them chatter "He's probably young but I know that he's down"Step on his neck as hard as your bulletproof vestHe don't mind, he know we'll never respect, the +good kid, m.A.A.d. city+All I see in this room, 20 Xanies and these 'shroomsGrown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane society?It's entirely stressful upon my brainYou hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for changeWhen violence is the rhythm inspired me to obtainThe silence in this room with 20 Xanies and 'shroomsSome grown-up candy I lost it, I feel it's nothing to loseThe streets sure to release the worst side of my bestDon't mind cause now you ever in debt, to +good kid, m.A.A.d. city+
