I used to wanna rap like Jay-Zuntil I finally realised that Jay wasn't meI took my time to jot down every line that's a quotableCritics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I dobecause I used to practice early morning and then after schoolI'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle youBut even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow youLike a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cutI'ma close cut to Common and Gucci ManeNow that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understandBecause I can touch the people and still keep it ghettoas an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirrorI wear a heart on my shoulder'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came overThen went to jail when we got olderThat shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focussedIn due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say declineThat shit's embarrassing huhHope no one pay you no mindBut it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in lineCan you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreamsand admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studioeven though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo'My pops got a different approach, yeah he believedBut he always questioned when I'ma drop my debut CDHow long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate niggaAt twenty-two I had two cars and my own place niggaIt's a sacrifice I try to tell himThat's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealousof all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shitI ain't tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quitI just wanna hear you heardWhat up Dasan? I ain't forgot niggaYou developed me, telling me I was hot niggaYou believed in me first, that's what's for sureAt the church recording, at the garage, but it workedBut me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passionA lot was going on in your life and you needed spaceBut still I should have came to you first to tell you what happenedBut I was seventeen and figured it's best I stay awayAnd I wrong, I was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what I'd doneBut I'm telling you we ain't doneMatter of fact, how's your sons? What they up to?Remember they used to run around while you had worked on ProTools?People I used to be in the booth till four in the morningwith school in the morning, yawning, but I was on itMe, you and Dave was on itBuzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape droppedWhere them beats nigga? It's been five years since we had rockedTime to be heardSo can you feel it?When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?Do it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?The truth can set you free if you Do the Right ThingWord to Spike Lee, don't he look like Sounwave?That's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays, like a dog in the nightTwenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutesto grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kiteI spread love like a Hippy, but I'm a +Black+ onewith Jesus Christ passion, I swear on the bibleTabernacle to all my rivals, I ain't madYou hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your badbecause I figure I can make a way with these stanzasI probably can't heal cancer, but I can heal the cityMy niggas, tell me you with meAnd if you is won't you pop my CD inOpen up your trunk, then let it bump, so I can be heardYeah, uh huh
