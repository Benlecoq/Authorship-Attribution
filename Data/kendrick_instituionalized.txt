Life can be like, a box of choc-o-lateQuid pro quo, somethin for somethin, that's the obviousOh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow itBitin my style, you're salmonella poison positiveI can just, alleviate the rap industry politicsMilk the game up, never lactose-intolerantThe last remainder of real shit, you know the obviousMe scholarship? No, streets put me through collegesBE all you can be, true, but the problem isA dream's only a dream if, work, don't follow itRemind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow thisI'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm prol'ly just way too loyalK-Dizzle would do it for you, my niggaz think I'm a godTruthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged...But somethin came over you once I took you to them fuckin BET AwardsYou lookin at artists like the harvestsSo many Rollies around you and you want all of 'emSomebody told me you thinkin 'bout snatchin jewelryI shoulda listened what my grandmomma said to me...Fuck am I s'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin licks?The constant big money talk about mansions and foreign whipsThe private jets and passports, presidential glass floorGold bottles, gold models stiffen up the ass forInstagram flicks, suckin dick, fuck is this?One more suck away from wavin flashy wristMy defense, mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got itIt's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?No more livin poor, meet my .44When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floorNow Kendrick, know they your co-workersBut it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkeyNow I can watch his watch on the TV and be okayBut see I'm on the clock once that watch landin in LARemember steal from the rich and givin it back to the poor?Well that's me at these awards
