Cloud nine, Kendrick Lamar, uhI take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunkI ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you wantBut if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chanceto witness the realest shit that's ever been told to manI found myself losing focus at a Sunday serviceEmbarrassed so I started questioning God, what is my purpose?He say to live the way he did, that's all he want from meSpread the word and witness, he rose on the first SundayI said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listenI opened my bible and searched to be a better Christianand this from a person that never believed in religionBut shit, my life is so fucked up man, I can't help but give inI'm giving testimonies to strangers I never metHopped on the pulpit and told 'em how I was truly blessedFelt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was overWalked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murderedand lost my faith againSingle black parent from Compton raising children of fourThat's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't knowHer day consists of working back and forth with babysittersCan't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sisterHer baby daddy ain't bout shit, that nigga ain't bout shitSpent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfitShe pray to God every night hoping that he'll matureand maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live forBaby wanna go back to school but she need some helpbecause it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourselfShe thought about credit card scams till she heard a voicethat said the Devil is a lie, make a better choiceAnd so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealingwith them crazy ass people at the county buildingLooked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better wayThen got a letter in the mail, lost her section 8Then lost her faith againThis for my people that stressing whenever times is hardYour mind's slipping, wondering is there really a God?Knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brainBut whenever it's pain, that feeling forever remainsWe can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayercause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchairAnd your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent careat the tender age of twelve, and you feel that no one caresSearching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrongJust know, when you feeling that way his spirit's in the roomI watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghostand wonder why I ain't never caught that feeling beforeMaybe they know him better, or I don't know no betterBut what I do know is that he's real and he lives foreverSo the next time you feel like your world's about to endI hope you studied because he's testing your faith againI'd rather not live like there isn't a Godthan die and find out there really is, think about it
