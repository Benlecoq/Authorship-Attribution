For the love of BIG, we bang outSince my man died, we don't hang outWe blow brains out, we tear the club up pullin things outMafia World, all my niggaz max outWe Bad Boys, why ya'll niggaz cracked outCoward niggaz, most are burried down southFar from gangstas, really hush puppiesNiggaz bearly speak when we discuss moneyNiggaz stay yappin when there's always somethin funnyThe realest niggaz never took nuthin from meRock ice, stay jig, fuck with niggaz that got drunk, and hate kidsGot niggaz on state bids, that hate movies like Rosewood and MatrixA yo, Biggie taught me well, Biggie told me how to flip bricks like cartwheelFor BIG I learn to grip aim and cock itOnce I got it, I lock itBanger, big city boy with deep pocketsSee me speak, that paper better be the topicI like my ice frozen like the AntarticI'm quick to finish it, your good to start itAnd with the flashy colors on, you just a target, Waitin for a hard hitI like marine blue, marine green, roll with a mean teamMeshed out, fresh out, and stay greamsWe big boys, we do big things, born in this county of kingsI ain't got shit, I spread things, take thingsFuck whenever my mood swings, from the summer for the winter to the springMy nigga ill's holdin it down for the beamLike BIG said, we do the real things, we still bubble and steal chainsStill tustle, still struggle, we feel painStill ride, still die for BIG's nameFor BIG I grip the cig, put six in your wigNot cause of what he said, cause of what he didWhen I hear that pop quiz, that's the way I was raised and thats the way it is for..We roll like the Panthers, show our guns on cameraDo jokes with police scanners, niggaz mediocre, full of dirt like hampersI roll with a bunch of niggaz that wear bandanas and rep...We kept it thurough, from the heart ripped the barrelB.K. style, see BIG howl, nowLets see who, wanna go against Mafia worldNiggaz nuthin but squirels, they know we rep...Niggaz tryin to get a nut, hit in the head or below the gutWood style roll'em up, get plucked, nigga whatGo back to spend a ton, and know cats wit gold toothsKnow my gat and bust for my nigga...
