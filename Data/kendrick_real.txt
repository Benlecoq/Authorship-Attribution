I promise that I know you very wellYour eyes never lie even if they tellSweet lullabies that come with a smellOf a dozen roses flippin' down the green hillYou living in a world that come with plan BCause plan A never relay a guaranteeAnd plan C never could say just what it wasAnd your plans only can pan around loveYou love him, you love them, you love herYou love so much, you love when love hurtsYou love red bottom and gold with the sequinYou love hand-bag on the waist of your jeanYou love french tip and trip that pay forYou love bank slip that tell you we paid moreYou love a good hand whenever the card dealtBut what love got to do with it when you don't love yourselfI promise that I know you very wellYour eyes never lie even if they fellOut the sky and your optics turn staleWhere they mold that's green, I can see you fit the billOf living in a world that come with Plan BCause Plan A only can make another mistakeAnd you can't see success coming from plan CWhen it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovelyAnd love them and love when you love herYou love so much, you love when love hurtsYou love fast cars and dead presidents oldYou love fast women, you love keepin' controlOf everything that you love, you love beefYou love streets, you love runnin', duckin' policeYou love your hood, might even love it to deathBut what love got to do with it, when you don't love yourself?The reason why I know you very wellCause we have the same eyes can't you tellThe days I tried to cover up and concealMy pride, it only made it harder for me to dealWhen living in a world that come with plan BA scapegoat cause plan A don't come freeAnd plan C just an excuse like becauseOr the word "but", but what if I got love?I love them, I love when I love herI love so much, I love when love hurtsI love first verse cause you're the girl I attractI love second verse cause you're the homie that packedBurner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratchI love what the both of you have to offerIn fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything elseBut what love got to do with it when I don't love myselfTo the point I should hate everything I do loveShould I hate living my life inside the clubShould I hate her for watching me for that reasonShould I hate him for telling me that I'm seasonShould I hate them for telling me ball outShould I hate street credibility I'm talkin' aboutHatin' all money, power, respect in my willOr hating the fact none of that shit make me real
