I never knew the world could be this madOnly vision I had of sex was callin' me badI never knew the world could be this coldOnly time a nigga died he was playing a roleBut now the niggas get their souls stole so oftenThey only did is offer gimits is awake in their coffinFrom NY to cope it down the holeShe said that office offers abortionsWithout precaution,Power to the people,There's too many who wanna be JordanToo many forces thinking they could make a fortune storyToo many wanna be actors instead of achiveing their mastersAt least the bachelor would know too many wanna be rappersThat's just statistics they'll be steak before he'll pay ChristLike niggas in the White House supplying white towelsOr Jim Crow Laws you probably missed itHard to be persistent when you tryin' to fight for your existencePerson, mad nervous you surrender of the sturvingLook them in the eyes flicks makes you dieYou know you merk 'em right therePlus his hide is like right hereSo you know that if you would fight fairThen you'd have him like cry scaredBut don't forget to tack your heartBy your right handSo listen loud and clearYou don't wanna lose your life thereDon't you show a slight tailOr let 'em sight fearJust let 'em dissapear in the night yeahWhat your life is, rabbi the clack isLeft alone in the apartmentSomeone's been jobless someone make dollarsShaking it topless andDaddy be gone said itTook off like ashesDizzy gain knowledgeI'm keeping it with the synapsisSaying shit like that make you wish you were adoptedTo escape the pain you joined the gangAnd get intoxicatedHad no shame, nothing wrong with some Mary JaneThe only thing is you do with the gameImagine me fed upA go getter, for more cheddarPour never, no more lettuce'Cause I know no betterNo error no stealsNo Kirk, No Lee, no schoolNo OJ, no talent, know meBut if I did say act rightWhat if I pack crack whiteWith my sack tightJoined the gang fightThey click clack tightSledding the vibeWith the black stripeAnd get my friend's the back knife'Cause that's lifeNigga
