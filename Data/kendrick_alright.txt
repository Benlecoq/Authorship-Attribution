Uh, and when I wake upI recognize you're lookin at me for the pay cutBut homicide be lookin at you from the face downWhen Mac-11 even boom with the bass down - SCHEMIN!And let me tell you 'bout MY lifePainkillers only put me in the twilightWhere pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlightNow tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get meReapin everything I sow, so my karma comeAnd heaven, no preliminary hearing, so my recordAnd my motherfuckin gang stands silence for the record, uih!Tell the world, I know it's too lateBoys and girls, I think I've gone crazyDrown inside my vices all dayWon't you please believe when I sayWhat you want? You a house? You a car?Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?Anything, see, my name is Lucy, I'm your dogMotherfucker, you can LIVE at the mallI can see the evil, I can tell it, I know when it's illegalI don't think about it, I deposit every other zeroThinkin of my partner put the candy painted on the RegalDiggin in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed youEveryday my logic, get another dollar just to keep youIn the presence of your chico -- ah~!I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see coolIf I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach youPet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's allPick back and chat, I trap the back for y'allI rap, I black on track and rest assuredMy rights, my wrongs I write 'til I'm right with God
