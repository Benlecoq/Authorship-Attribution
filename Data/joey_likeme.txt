If looks could kill I let the swank drill like a deadly weaponI drop bombs on an enemy at any secondLook at me wrong I turn you to tomb stonesLock you in the crosses, and you gone, then I throw my deuce upSip sangrita's with your se–orita, like me gustaSee with that early morning cockadoo up to your roosterI bet my cockiness will boost her confidenceThen you gon' wonder where your highness wentSo we burn the mary jane til' the third degreeSome niggas bitin' flows yo, that's burglarySame niggas actin' like they never heard of meA fuck nigga could get clocked, yo that's word to meMy mind boggles when time togglesIn the ocean of stars it's hard to find goggles, we twist it upSo we put it in the airDon't let the j's start unravellingWe gettin' blown like a javelinShe throw it back like she time travelin'Rocked the boat so well, she jumped out and started paddlingI'm screaming "land ho!" 'bout to hit for sureI motorboat it slow then I ripped the flowI'm pretty sure, like nice beat, this thatEven at my weakest I still leave her speechlessHow you like those peaches?Find me rotting the apple'Bout to bump so plump, 'bout to lock in the grappleFeeling like the highest man about to tackleFacts like the chat under the cap of the SnappleCats get decapitated for actin' a foolBlacks get their ass sprayed just for makin' a move
