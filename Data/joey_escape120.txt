I could never forget them gloomy daysAlthough I regret where my time was playedIf I could go back, some things would be changedAnd I would know that, for a fact, it was fameThat drew me to this unfamiliar side of my brainThat withdrew me from familiar and the closest remainsAlthough I'm gaining ends now, I'm loosing friendsThey say that time is money, and my time is well spentGirlfriend hit me up to chill, but does this shit make sense?And I don't expect for you to know if you ain't paying rentI got to make this album, and hold it down for my campSurrounded us all like bonfireWhen I lay a verse down that's born fireI was born fireWent outside this morning, morning, uhSeen the sky was falling, falling, yeahOld man no longer snoring, snoring, ahThe rain just won't stop pouring, pouring, uhWhats heaven's capitol like, like, li-likeMaybe I can crash tonight, night, nightCause I'm trapped inside this hell, hell, holeGod, please answer your cell, cell, phoneI'm coming home tonight, can't touch no microphone tonightOutside my comfort zone tonightMy brain's blown my dome tonightTonight's the night, don't you try to put up a fightDon't you trying looking for lifeCause I'm bout to take that flight
