Sometimes I feel alienatedBecause I'm not up in this alien plantOr on the radio sayin'Fuck 'em: broads we don't love 'em we degradin' 'emBut always find my self back at the backanadianBlood vessels poppin' out my craniumsNiggas askin' when the tape gon' dropBut I got nothin' to say to themBecause I been stackin this skillAlthough my passion is realI'm too cool to cash in the feelWhen I should be cashin' a milIt's something bout me being youngerThat affected my hungerGot older in numberRealized I can't count on these hundredsTo determine my elationPursuit of happiness I keep pacin'These motherfucka's facesThese ain't fear racesThey just let the fit erase usAdopted by the slumSon of cards this is how they raped usYo son we gotta raise upDon't let them just array us'Till we raisins in the sunSo we gotta wake upGot a whole bunch of shit up on my plate nowThinkin' like in the man garden it's a snake nowCause I don't know who to believeOr who to deceiveGot me thinkin' ISold my soul and they received a receiptBut I won't proceed to retreatJigga told me watch your thrown seatAnd now I sees itAnd the respect to bigI gotta cease itAnd I hope he see meCause these niggas don't want beef with my talentsThey ain't fit for this greenThey just caesar saladYou think because you avid they just gonna let you have itIt's a lot to learn and that my nigga need to ask usIt's the axis of the earth at the birthI found a new balanceAnd now I walk on water just like I knew balance just like a relativeMarijuana sedatives got me thinkin' I should put a bomb right where the senate isCause they corruptin' the youthWe ain't inductin' the truthLookin' at the president like yo it must be nothin' to youI passed the dutch to left and it started to make senseIt's funny how I see it more straight when I'm bentYou've been warned on the wrist to take a sit on topBeen on clockCause you could see that I been on watchIt don't stop'Till you make the sacrificesTrainin' was priceless to ices and devicesWhen the light switch I shift like I'm typin'Livin' in the era where christ is the crisisThe lifeless in the trance actin like yo mansBitch niggas only know that transactions is the plansBut the mic is in my hands so I faild the boothThe blacker the berry is the more sour the fruitThey ejectin' us to make us cowardsTo the power of truthBecame flowers from rootsAnd now we just move in cahootsI move from the stoop and put my foot right down on the asphaltEvery night I ask lord if this what I asked for
