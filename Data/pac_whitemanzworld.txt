Dear sister, got me twisted up in prison I miss yaCryin lookin at my niece's and my newphew's pictureThey say don't let this cruel world get ya, kinda suspiciousSwearin one day you might leave me, for somebody that's richerTwist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrowGotta make if I have to beg or borrowReadin love letters; late night, locked down and quietIf brothers don't recieve they mail best believe we riotEatin Jack-Mack, starin at walls of silenceinside this cage where they captured all my rage and violenceIn time I learned a few lessons, never fall for richesAplogizies to my TRUE sisters; far from bitchesHelp me raise my black nation reperations are due, it's trueCaught up in this world I took advantage of youSo tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girlsBorn black in this white man's world - and all I heard wasBein born with less I must confess only adds on to the stressTwo gunshots to my homie's head, dyed in his vestShot him to death and left him bleedin for his family to seeI pass his casket gently askin, is there heaven for G's?My homeboy's doin life, his baby momma be stressinSheddin tears when her son, finally ask that questionsWhere my daddy at? Mama why we live so poor?Why you cryin? Heard you late night through my bedroom doorNow do you love me mama? Whitey keep on callin me nigga?Get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm biggerAnd still thuggin in this jail cell, missin my blockHearin brothers screamin all night, wishin they'd stopProud to be black but why we act like we don't love ourselvesDon't look around busta (you sucka) check yourselvesKnow what it MEANS to be black, whether a man or girlWe still strugglin, in this white man's worldSo tell me why you - changed to choose a new direction, in the blink of an eyeMy time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die?Not gon' cry, why should I careLike we holdin on to lost love that's no longer thereCan you please help me, God bless me please keep my seeds healthyMakin all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthyHopin they bury me with ammunitions, weed, and shellsJust in case they trip in heaven - ain't no G's hellSister sorry for the pain that I caused your heartI know I'll change if you help me, but don't fall apartRest in peace to Latasha, Lil' Yummy, and KatoToo much for this cold world to take - ended up bein fatalEvery women in America, especially blackBear with me, can't you see, that we under attackI never meant to cause drama, to my sister and mamaHope we make it, to better times, in this white man's world
