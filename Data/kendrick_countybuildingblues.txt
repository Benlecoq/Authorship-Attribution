I've been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and PacWas on Rosecrans in that burger stand at 95People staring at 'em in amazementReservations at the Days Innwe was living out a hotel at the timeBreakfast, lunch and dinner chicken from Kentucky FriedMama babysitting Section 8 vouchers to moveWith nothing else to lose but a burger flippin' jobClose my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine this a mansionGold ballroom AK-47 dancingHowling at the moon was a pack of hungry babiesHope you feed 'em soon bite your back you die of rabiesEveryday we pray to eat at the table of SizzlersBut never made that visit, if better days was on its wayThen it made the decision, to make the wrong turnSo for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burnCouple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety (uh huh)Played the passenger I think it's five years after eighty-seven do the math ' 92 don't you be lazy (I won't)Looking out the window, notice all the essentialsof a block party that stop for a second then it rekindleLike a flame from a trick candle everybody got dentalInsurance 'cause we 'bout to flossyou get that couch I sent you?I heard that from a block away probably had credentialsof a scholar but shit not todaythem Dayton spokes was his to takeRefrigerators, barbecue pits and Jordan kicksThey did invasions while helicopters recorded itHello Mi-Mister Miyagi I want them ten woo-woofersSay that you got me if not I'll dig in your drawer for itThe swap meet was the bull's eye like TaurusesMurder was the melody you should know what the chorus isPapa you really telling me we can just get some more of it if we run out?He said lil nigga today the poor is richDon't tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bombIf she ask just know you have to lie and son don't forgetBitches ain't shit, hoes ain't neitherNiggas gon' snitch watch the company you keepingAnd one day you'll put money in the ghetto when you got itRather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots
