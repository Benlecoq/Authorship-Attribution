From the block to the topBudha baggies in a sockOnly thing that changed nowIs we ain't runnin' out of stockUse to beg mom dukes for lunch moneyHonies used to run from meWhen pockets was dust bunniesNow what's funnyIs when done came up and conqueredEven the future lookin' bonkers from Compton to YonkersThough them gangstas grillI tell 'em keep that drama awayDon't fuck with thievesI like Jay so who sponsorin' the tapeThey launchin' out straightsI'm tryin' not to get sprayedWhether it's spitter or a quiter behind the triggerApproachin' his prey his eyes biggerWon't stop to consider what's right or wrongBecause it's hard liquor that's inside his liverTraded in my Nikes for a new micI guess it's safe to sayHe sold soles for his new lifeLike they were tryna blind usBut we know the true designerThey didn't wanna see us find the divinersSo now we hit the vinesUp day and night on the regularI know my momma prayin'Like she want me reach my aims in lifeBut just stay in sightSo I'm shootin' for my dreamsHit the booth and it boost my esteemThe Pro Era crew recruitin'And them fiends by the boat loadNigga caught a wave and now he surfin' coastalThey don't feel the nameBut they say that music dope thoughFuck it that's how it's supposed to goThese bloggers too emotionalThey'll be postin' youUntil labels start Interscopin' youBy then it's WaleAnd I'll be chillin' where I layCause I rather see the topThan to be livin' where I lay
