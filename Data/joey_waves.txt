Uh! Since nine five, mama been workin nine fiveAnd I know the landlord fed up with our liesSo we pray to the Gods, the Jahs and the AllahsTo keep us safe and watch our lives 'Cause all we tryin to do is do goodPut on my hood when I walk through hoods'Cause, these niggas these days is locoYou'll get in ya vocals if you ain't localYeah, that's why I'm tryin to go globalYeah, that's why I'm tryin to be a mogulAnd I'm hopeful that me spittin it soulful Will have me in the Daily Postal flyin coastal eatin tofuLike I told you I know niggas who trash rappinWorried 'bout the trendin fashions rather than ascendin passionThey want me send 'em tracks but I just send 'em laughinRight after I start laughin, they askin what happened?But back to the chapterMama told me follow my dreams, should never have to ask her, toSo that's what I do, become an MC masterSince then it's been a disaster for you and your favorite rapperGo ahead ask 'em, who is Joey Bad?Watch 'em grasp, asthma, damn it's so sadHe paused the chatter, 'cause he know he rather back upThen to admit the kid is hotter than magmaBut fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due'Cause you ain't 'gon like the karma when it's set up on youIt can get you on your medical, fuck you up in your decimalsOr get you two to three for residue found it your retinueUh! And they told me not to be so complexAnd The Source, alfredo of courseThere I go again, steppin out of line, runnin off courseI heard reports that it's like sexual intercourseWith your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walkFor it is not faux, nor false that this kid from the northSpeaks with forced supports of reinforced assaultsI'm sure by now you can assume he never lostUnless with some form of divorce, or a corpseBorn boss no days off, child laborLet me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoesYeah!Yeah! But it's far from overWon't stop 'til I meet Hova and my mama's in a rover'Til I'm an owner, of the world's illest motorsI blow like super novas in your daughter's room on a posterKnown as history's biggest musical composerNo disrespect to Bob Mar, but yeah, another stonerMarijuana my odor, and when I get olderHope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovumLike three times, have three kids, I hopeMe and my wife can show 'em not to make the same mistakes you know that we didI hope that they acknowledge the knowledge 'cause yeah, they 'gon need it'Cause when my parents tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive itCouldn't believe it, 'til I saw with my own pupilsFelt bad when I learned their advice was truly usefulBut fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutualEven though over time, my punishments they grew more crucialShould use the word brutal, 'cause my parents mad strictHope one day I'll attract the likes of even MadlibGo gold on mad shit and hear my songs masteredUntil then, all I can do is imagine
