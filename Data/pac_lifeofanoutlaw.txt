Why explain the game? Niggaz ain't listeninStuck in positions. If victims can't stand the heatThen stay the fuck out the kitchenHave these bustas switchin, lookin at me meanItchin, givin suckas plenty spaceHave these bitch niggaz snitchinWhere are we now? Guns found daily, the feds surely hopethat they could finally nail me for sellin dopeThey backwards, make tracks burst whenever I rapAttack, words bein known to explode on contactExtreme at times, blinded by my passion and furyLook at me laugh at my competition flashin my jewelryYou'd stay silent if you niggaz knew me, truly effectiveThe shit you heard ain't do me justice - got a death wish, bitch!Run up, face me and trace wit an infared beamIt seems niggaz ain't recognize my teamAin't nobody holdin you back, explode the track to confettiUnload it, cause niggaz ain't ready - the life of an outlaw!Code three, attack formation, pull out your pistolsKeep an eye out for the devils cause they itchin to get youMerciless madman screamin kamikaze in tongueAutomatic gunfire, makin all my enemies runWho should I call when I'm shot and bleedinIndeed the possibility has part a chase in creamDope got me hatin fiends, scheme with my team, just a chosen fewMy foes victim of explosives, come closer, exhale the fumesWe got memories fadin fast. A slave for cashAccelerate, mash, blast, then dashDon't look now. How you like it, rawNiggaz ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws - never surrenderDeath is for a son to stay free; I'm thugged outFuck the world cause this is how they made meScarred but still breathin believe in me and you could see the victoryA warrior with jewels, can you picture me? Life of an outlaw
