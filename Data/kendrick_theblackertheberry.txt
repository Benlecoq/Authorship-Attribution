I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015Once I finish this witnesses will convey just what I meanBeen feelin this way since I was 16, came to my sensesYou never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant itI'm African-AmericanI'm African, I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village, pardon my residenceCame from the bottom of mankindMy hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wideYou hate me, don't you? You hate my peopleYour plan is to terminate my culture, you're fuckin evilI want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkeyYou vandalize my perception but can't take style from meAnd this is more than confessionI mean I might press the button just so you know my discretionI'm guardin my feelings - I know that you feel itYou sabotage my community makin a killinYou made me a killer, emancipation of a real niggaI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015Once I finish this witnesses will convey just what I meanI mean it's evident that I'm irrelevant to societyThat's what you're tellin me, penitentiary would only hire meCurse me 'til I'm deadChurch me with your fake prophesizin that I'ma be just another slave in my headInstitutionalize, manipulation and liesReciprocation of freedom only live in your eyesYou hate me, don't you? I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourselfJealous of my wisdom and cards I dealtWatchin me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel outMuscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'boutAh, black and successful, this black man meant to be specialCAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you?How can I tell you I'm makin a killin?You made me a killer, emancipation of a real niggaI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015When I finish this if you listen then sure you will agreeThis plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatredIt's genocism, it's grimy, little justificationI'm African-AmericanI'm African, I'm black as the heart of a fuckin AryanI'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my FrenchBut fuck you, no fuck y'all! That's as blunt as it getsI know you hate me, don't you? You hate my peopleI can tell cause it's threats when I see you, I can tell cause your way's deceitfulKnow I can tell because you're in love with that Desert EagleThinkin maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed himIt's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to warTwo tribal armies that wanna build and destroyRemind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next doorBeefin with Pirus, only death settle the scoreSo don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the PanthersOr tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-dayOr eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdaysOr jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsementsOr watch BET cause urban support is importantSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the streetwhen gang bangin make me kill a nigga blacker than me?Hypocrite!
