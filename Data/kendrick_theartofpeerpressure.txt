Me and my niggas four deep in a white ToyotaA quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange sodaJanky stash box when the Federales will roll upBasketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odorWe on the mission for bad bitches in troubleI hope the universe love you todaycause the energy we bringing sure to carry awaya flock of positive activists and fill their body with hate, if it's necessaryBumping Jeezy' first album, looking distractedSpeaking language only we know, you think it's an accentThe windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass itHot-boxing like George Foreman grilling the massesof the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girlsand asked them what they working with, look at meI got the blunt in my mouth, usually I'm drug-freeBut shit, I'm with the homiesIt's 2:30 and the sun is beamingAir conditioner broke, and I hear my stomach screamingHungry for anything unhealthy, and if nutrition can help meI'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatingWe speeding on the 4-0-5, passing WestchesterYou know the light-skinned girls in all their little dresses, good LordThey knew we weren't from round therecause every time we down there, we pulling out the Boost Mobile sim cardsBougie bitches with no extensionsHood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combinationBefore we sparked the conversationWe seen three niggas in colors we didn't like, then started interrogatingI never was a gangbangerI mean I never was stranger to the folk neither, I really doubt itRush a nigga quick, and then we laugh about itThat's ironic cause I've never been violentuntil I'm with the homiesBragging bout the episode we just hadA shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that badI'm usually a true firm believer of bad karmaConsequences from evil will make your past haunt yaWe tryna conquer the city with disobedienceQuick to turn it up, beefing if we ain't got the CD inBut Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still, nigga what is you saying?Pull in front of the house that we've been camping out for like two monthsThe sun is going down as we take whatever we wantI hit the back window in search of any NintendoDVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunkWe made a right, then made a left, then made a rightThen made a left, we was just circling lifeMy mama called, kicking itI should have told her I'm probably bout to catch my first offensewith the homies
