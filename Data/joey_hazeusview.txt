You ain't running with the apes yetApex at the empire state neckHand no crown, my niggas take thatIn this state of mind, gotta state facts suspect niggaGet your wig pushed back tonight, to 1999Who'd've thought that 19 I'd be in my primeThrow up the right scheme everything else alignHere's a penny for your thoughts another one another oneEventually the dream was boughtNow that's a real, real, real mind fuckMight fuck up your mind if you're lighting upMake sure to take a tight [?] if you toughImma titan, like Zeus I enlighten themKick flows, till it's kung-fu fighting themIs it him, it is you who was nice as him?I don't see nobody no, noI don't see nobody no, noYou rap niggas ain't safe yetI keep the bombs in my basementWhen I detonate you can feel the vibrationsI got ya mind shaking and in my right my light gon spark for generationsOne day my voice will be heardOn every radio station cause fate rearranging and changing and thisEveryday living in this life I seeThat in every way they wanna see my life deceaseBut I survive the question is for how longSince my homie died, I been tryin to hold onThe happy days of my life is now all goneBut I cope with that weed I smoke and writing these songsBut it's should I stay should I go?Should I stay should I go?I don't know, I don't knowLord please let me knowEverything cool like in the state of mindAt this state in my correct, cool, calm, collectDeflect the corrupt with intellectI talk too much, the jig is up he has risen upFrom a division of, most kings, with they vision precision for precisionHis mind splitting, and soul upliftingBut still feel so trapped in the solar system
