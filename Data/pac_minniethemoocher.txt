I know this girl and her name is MinnieLivin' in the projects didn't own a pennyMet her at a school dance so I took a chanceWalked her to the parkin' lot for a little romanceGot to my car, put the key in the ignitionturned on the slow jams, I was on a missionI was catchin' wild things like the chicken poxI was "J" and knockin' boots right down the socksShe was freaky and wild, oh man could I call it?But when I dropped her off, she had stole my walletI couldn't quite believe that why a hoocher-coocher?But that was my first experience with MINNIE THE MOOCHER!!Minnie the Moocher was a legend on the block I'm fromA dream girl to many brothers, but true to noneHer reputation was enormous - a real go getterAnd once a brother met her, he wanted to get with herMaybe it was her smile, her personality orthe way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she woreBut whatever it was, Minnie the Moocher was an expertReal heart-breaker, but never get hurtShe had this boyfriend, his name was Diamondhelpin' Minnie out with the little social climbin'Met with Politicians, peace to many othersSuddenly and instantly, they became her loversShe took the power that they possessedAnd Minnie did it all without gettin' undressedMinnie dissed Diamond sayin' that he could not live with herBut he wanted payment for the things he did for herHe grabbed the gun sittin' on the nightstandMinnie held the bullets, put the pistol in her right handShe was a legend to everyone who knew herThat's is my memory of Minnie the Moocher
