Venue after venue, I've been throughComing to the telly, so I can bend youSend you to the store, condoms and moreJealous females, call you sluts and whoresCould it be my hardcore metaphorMake sweat pour on the bedroom floorOpen up the Lex doorJump on in, I'm kind of tiredI'm a roll blunts while you spinYou got your license, right? Alright, no swervingHair blonde out, Madonna style like a virginSplurging, Dom P., Ro-seMuch foreplay, that's my forteNiggas see the ring, baguettes to deathShe looking for a man, honey he just leftViolate me, he get beat to deathGoodfellas squeeze every shell they got leftGrand Marnier increase the don strengthTwo four-fifths within my arms lengthWith a calm breath I say we gots to floatThrow Little Cease the keys to the boatTongue all down her throat, you know the routineGot my dick large like Bruce SpringsteenAnd you mean too, eyes greenish blueGot the Coogi sweater with the bubble FubuBeautiful, that's how the night goesGet out them tight clothesGet in some night clothesI invite those girls that smoke lyeKeep it real with youYou keep it real with IWe be tight like frog's assHave you screaming "Biggie, Biggie give me one more chance"
