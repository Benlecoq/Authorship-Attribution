Another day in the ghetto One look outside I'm already upset yoIt look about a hundred-and-two It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nuttin to doUhh, I'm intrrupted by a phone ring {*brrrrring*}Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfuckin thing"Hello hello?  Can I speak to Biggie?"Yo who dis?  "Taisha"  Yo call back, I'm busyWhy don'tcha hit me on the box a little laterWashed up, got dressed, hits the elevatorSteps out it's the same old scene Dopefiend, crackfiend, eyewitness news teamI seen a honey with a butt lookin butter softI know she looks much better with them clothes up offSittin all thick, with the ruby red lipstick {*SMACK*}That's the one I gotta get withShe said "If I get witchu I gotta get witcha whole hood rat crewWhatcha I think I do?  Sling skins for a livinMy name ain't November, this ain't ThanksgivinYou aint Michael BivinsMack it up flip it, rub it downDo me baby, I ain't downMy name ain't Tupac I don't "Get Around"You hittin this nigga, how that sound?"Huh, first of all you got me mixed up withSomebody ya done slept with, hold upThat's my Neneh Cherry shit, I got somethin slickerLet me just sip up on this liquorAll I wanna do is smoke a little chronicSlam ya like Onyx, and get ya hooked on this Biggie Smalls phonics, 102How to squeeze 22's in them Reeboks shoes, HUH?I said walk me upstairs, cause I forgot my PhilliesShe said "I don't care, just dont be actin silly"I knew I had her trapped with my hardcore rapAnd it wouldn't take a second 'fore I had her on her backFoolin with the bra strap, threw on my Silk cd cause, "I wanna get freaky wit'chou"Lose control on the skins is all I can pictureNow I'm about to hitcha
