More than an adversary I'm very quickI'm ready to hit 'em with this gift I'm equipped to kickSo grab your coat and your hat, cause I'm prepared to clownThey're scared of the sound, let's draw these motherfuckers downOh shit, 2pacalypse is back and strappedAttacking the packs, I'm kicking the facts for stacks to rap And those that max, relax and let the blacks get jackedI'm getting taxed, my pack's a pack of angry blacksI'm ready to goI'm ripping the shows, hitting the dough, gettin the hoes clothesPumping the fo', gangster ho, cause the nose knowsCheck the pose, froze, when you see me closePunks you gonna roast, host, in a cloud of smokeChoked on some potent dank smokeWrote, rhymes that'll bring me bank notesNope, I ain't the type of fella that you used toK-k-kickin the funky flavor for the juice the dope producesRun for cover when you hear the bass drumOne verse is all it takes; something wicked this way comes
