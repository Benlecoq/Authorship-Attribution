This feeling is unmatchedThis feeling is brought to you by adrenaline and good rapBlack Pendleton ball cap We don't share the same synonym, fall back Been in it before internet had new actsMimickin radio's nemesis may be wackMy innocence limited, the experience lackedTen of us with no tentative tactic that crackedthe mind of a literate writer, but I did it in factYou admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plasticRemember scribblin scratchin dilligent sentences backwardsVisitin freestyle cyphers for your reactionNow I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastestGamblin Benjamin benefits, sinnin in trafficSpinnin women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashionWinnin in, every decision, Kendrick is master that mastered itIsn't it, lovely how menaces turned attraction?Pivotin rappers, finish your fraction while writin blue magicThank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaqueBut what's better than that? The fact it brought me back homeI know everything... I know everything, know myselfI know morality, spirituality, good and bad healthI know fatality might haunt you, I know everythingI know Compton, I know street shit, I know shit that's consciousI know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsorsI know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karmaI know everything, I know history, I know the universe works mentallyI know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for meI know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and moneyI know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's orneryI know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkiesI know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognitionThe way I'm rewarded, well that's God's decisionI know you know that lines from Compton School DistrictJust give it to the kids, don‰Ûªt gossip about how it was distributedI know how... people workI know the price of life, I'm knowin how much it‰Ûªs worthI know what I know and I know it well not to ever forgetUntil I realized I didn‰Ûªt know shit, the day I came homeI met a little boy that resembled my featuresNappy afro, gap in his smileHand-me-down sneakers bounced through the crowdRun a number on man and woman that crossed himSun beamin on his beady beads exhaustedTossin footballs with his ashy black anklesBreakin new laws momma passed on home traininHe looked at me and said, "Kendrick you do know my language You just forgot because of what public schools had painted Oh I forgot, +Don't Kill My Vibe+, that's right, you're famous I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken But never mind, you're here right now don't you mistake it It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil You spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you I can attempt, to enlighten you without frightenin you If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace Then be an advocate, tell your homies especially to come back home"I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetiteFor the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?Tell me somethin, got me losin my mind - AHH~!!You make me wanna jumpI been lookin for you my whole life, an appetiteFor the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?Tell me somethin, think I'm losin my mind, ha!I say where you at, from the front to the backI'm lookin for you I react, only when you reactHa, I thought I found you, back in the ghet-toWhen I was seventeen with the .38 spec-ialMaybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not realMaybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anywayDon't lie to me I'm suicidal anyway, I can be your advocateI can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is...
