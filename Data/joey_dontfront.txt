It all started with this patch reheardAnd after that it came the sexual worstI'm meeting shorty up to patch her a verseShe played body and I collideWith the vibe when I'm inside the wallsI cut my dotties on the side'Cause I decide that she all mine'sI keep her in my eyes all the timesNot because I don't trust herI just can't get enough of herOn the phone late until her mom dukesBecause of her, she played the hustle upAnd I'm like mad 'cause mostMan swammin love and ain't afraid to admit itBe blowing up a lime man I swear I'm addicted, butIt's all cool 'cause when I lie for ya I foolThey say men lie and women lay naked that's all for meDon't be so mad after the first nightRight, so what the fuck is love at the first sightIf you ask me and not the stupid analogyMakes it cover flaws in the female anatomyIt's like a massacre when less occurI got a massive urge but I had to learnHeard you had it on locks on pass awayI sat you heard sit back observeThat she make me feel goodIs all I ask of herAnd the clouds they would've knownWe would've crash and burnI pray long and hardHoping things will last with herI ain't mad at herBut I really wish that it ain't have to hurtLet's be blunt we're best budsBoth knew our role this is more than just a crushI used to pick a rub long before I lust to touchBut know I really even see it,Everybody hurt not even the LordForce that we can keep upIf you don't wanna know start campin on the loveEverytime that we would kick itI make sure I had some toeI thought I knew her better than anyone would knowBegged her at her friends, but home then I would take herDidn't know that she was a hoeThat only wanted my paperWhenever I was with her, my mind was just relaxedCould've been the high time because I swore we were a match inI admit it girl you fine as hellDon't know your perfume but you exhert the finest smellYou try to find it, I follow a trailShe left a few all other aside off the jailThat's all a part of the taleHey yo don't tell me be patientWith no doctor prescriptionEmotionally pretentiousAnd provocative figuresShould've known you missed a noteLike the eye would switch itRemember hate the gameBut she spot in some glitchesIt's a simulation yeahIt's demolationTake off your shirtLet me feel manipulatedMy heart like in HimalayasBut yeah I got the slayerI'm crushing on you sweetheartBut yeah I'm a playerSort 'em like I see 'emBaby let me coach youAnd I know I'm not the first jerk to approach youSo this ain't nothing new to you, nothing unusualNothing you ain't used to so myNothing is useableWe all try when you go byWe all hide, trush isI'm never homeAnd I'm calling that's whereThe heart liesSo label me as heartlessThere's nothing I don't careI just learned to use my heart lessThe insanity and alot stressIt put me in a stateThey just started taking the tone on meKept the secrets from meKept emotions how I hold beliefAlways kept the L so I know defeatSo everything will feel much better as soonAs you know I'll leaveNow sure if this is the less of meYou think I'm mediocreI was still body with a glove onYou know I'm coma, I'm in animal pauseBut you got it offWhen it flood I used to always feel like NoahAnd I know I know herHad this kind of skills I have to show herI told her I'm the niggaShe seein' on the postersCame back throughAnd I put it in the hostelJust had to teach her one typePut it down, don't really give a fuck thoughDon't frontAnd tell your bitch don't front thoughDon't front
