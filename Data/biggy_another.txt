Uh-huh, uhh, uhhI know he don't treat you like I treat youTime to explain your game is see-throughSex is lethal, I ain't gon' lieMeans to get ya back, I ain't gon' tryLike this y'all, my girl sucked anotha nigga dick y'allLight skinned with the chromed out six y'allThought they was creepin, took trips to V-A every third weekendWhile you was sleepin, he hit you on the boxSixty-nine code non-stopShoulda left ya then, but my heart said notYou knew too much, the relationship grew too muchYou knew about the crack vials, means to be trialedWay I hid dough under the bathroom tileWaited for a while, thought you was my right thingThen things got frighteningPeep the scene, sorta like Sam RothsteinGuess you Ginger, huh, go figureNever thought you could be a gold diggerTake my dough and spend with the next niggaAsked my man Trigga, my ace boom coonTold me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloonNow I'm like Brandy, "Sittin in My Room"Pissy drunk listenin to Stylistic tunesOr the O'Jays, thinkin bout the old daysMy nigga's like, "Fuck that bitch, go playBaller, did she beep you?  Don't call herGuess who I seen, that freak bitch PaulaShe was askin bout ya whereaboutsHere's the digits, I know you can wear that outTear that out the frame, ya game so tightYou'll be all fuckin night"
