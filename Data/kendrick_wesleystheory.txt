When I get signed, homie I'ma ack a foolHit the dance flo', strobe lights in the roomSnatch ya lil' secretary bitch for the homiesBlue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkeyI'ma buy a brand new Caddy on voguesTrunk the hood up, two times, deuce fourPlatinum on er'rythang, platinum on wedding ringMarried to the game and a bad bitch choseWhen I get signed homie, I'ma buy a strapStraight from the CIA, set it on my lapTake a few M-16s to the hoodPass 'em all out on the block, what's good?I'ma put the Compton Swap Meet by the White HouseRepublican run up, get socked outHit the Pres with a Cuban link on my neckUneducated but I got a million-dollar check, like thatWhat you want? You a house? You a car?Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?Anything, see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dogMotherfucker, you can live at the mallI know your kind (That's why I'm kind)Don't have receipts? (Aw man, that's fine)Pay me later, wear those gators, cliche and say fuck your hatersI can see the bottle in you, I can see the dollar in youLittle white lies, but it's no white-collar in youBut it's whatever though because I'm still followin youBecause you make me live forever baby, count it all together babyThen hit the register and make me feel better babyYour horoscope is a Gemini, two sidesSo you better cop everything two timesTwo coupes, two chains, two c-notesToo much ain't enough, both we knowChristmas, tell 'em what's on your wish listGet it all, you deserve it, KendrickAnd when you get the White House, do youBut remember you ain't pass economics in schoolAnd everything you buy, taxes will denyI'll Wesley Snipe yo' ass befo' thirty-five
