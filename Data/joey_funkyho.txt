Words to my motherTwo things I never doIs leave the crib without some rubbersOr tell a funky ho I love herThese broads be trying to getA brother caught upIn this sticky situationMissing menstruationCycles, they all psychoAsk MichaelBefore you give a noteFor Billie Jean's and the nice clothesLike woo don't let them trap youOn the tight rope with spike holesIn the condom to form a zygote over nightAsk Quan he know what it's likeHe wore a hat but it exploded twiceBut fuck a bad bitchI knew this rap shitAnd put it over lifeOn the coldest nightsAnd shine like the solar strikeAnd I swear I got the weirdest cases pipeChicks in to weirdest placesFrom roof tops, to staircasesLike get a load on their facesFace it if you fear hate itYou get put it on this girls faceHey yo, I'm attached too, to the cash rulesBout to go nuts niggas get their attitudesTo these cash youWho you know that cool that they drip swagooAnd I'm here to stay like tattoos on statuesCheck your mirror nigga that's the second timeI passed you, eating my gas fumeGot me thinking I could gas youAnd your girl got gas tooShe let me tackle before I touch and I stapleAnd as you decide to put her shackleI'm that dude, fuck valuesPump up the volume, all up in the cutNo alchool just bad boozeTryin to find the path to bring him back tooLike a taboo, that poo, got back chicksThat I feel bad forLoosing 'til they back bonesLook it at my cock tipDown and doin' all no matter what the synapsis isAll it takes is some exotic piffAnd all your conscience tap exclusively vodka and shit
