Uh, me and my niggas tryin' to get it, ya bish Hit the house lick, tell me is you with it, ya bish? Home invasion was persuasive From nine-to-five I know it's vacant, ya bish Dreams of livin' life like rappers do Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool I fucked Sherane then went to tell my brosThen Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish Park the car then we start rhymin', ya bish The only thing we had to free our mind Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs You lookin' like an easy come up, ya bish A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish And that's a lifestyle that we never knew Go at a reverend for the revenueDreams of livin' life like rappers do Bump that new E-40 after school You know "Big Ballin' with my Homies" Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational Back to reality we poor, ya bish Another casualty at war, ya bish Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish That Louis Burger'll never be the same A Louis belt will never ease that pain)But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin' Gang signs out the window, ya bish Hopin' all of em offend you, ya bish They say your hood is a pot of gold And we gon' crash it when nobody's home
