Back once again, hello it's yo' favorite mellow schizoThe pavement on this yellow brick roadFuckin' up my mentalMy mood just like the tempoHeartbeat, that instrumentalI never lack potentialEvery track is essentialEvery project is special, abundant and fundamentalGive a fuck about hundredsAs long as it's for my mentalWith wisdom from what I've been throughKnowledge that some can't get toUnderstanding that college is only out for a nickelIt could all be so simpleTune it to the metronomeThis how I used to feel back on the metro homeFresh outta class I knew these days, they wouldn't lastJust a stepping stone I gotta passAnother story for the lapBut fuck it, give him glory when he crashHe gettin' revved up, heads upAnd he's coming fastHe paved the lane before the cashThey tryna swerve me out of thatBut I don't just got speed, niggaI handle my ass, pedal to the gasLife is but a getaway dashMy mama stash guarded by my pen and padI'm drawin' weapons with the rapsYou shoot, I shoot back no questions askedRaise your hands for the realest cat aliveAnd I remember sittin' in my room all aloneStarring at my ceiling fan, getting in my zoneMama was never homeWoke up one morning, papa was goneYoung and lost so I ease my mind to popular songsAnd of course I sold my mind to musicWriting everything I thoughtStarted openin' my mind, then I send in a broadThey don't know what my a sinnin' has causedMy third eye been blinking sinceIrv Gotti been Inc. and Murder in storesAt least that's how Irv gotta be thinkingIf I'm takin' a loss and I'm better next weekAnd I'm never weakerNever sinking on the fucking deep endAny shit I missed I prolly peaked it
