Can't change the world unless we change ourselvesDie from the sicknesses if we don't seek the healthAll eyes be my witness when I speak what's feltFull house on my hands, the cards I was dealtThree K's, two A's in AmeriKKKa-KaI'm just a black spade spawned out the nebulaAnd everything I do or say today that's worthwhileWill for sure inspire actions in your first child, I'll begin my verse nowSometimes I speak and I feel like it ain't my wordsLike I'm just a vessel channelin' inside this universeI feel my ancestors unrested inside of meIt's like they want me to shoot my chance in changin' societyBut, how do I go about it? Tell me where I startMy destiny rerouted when I chose to follow heartYou told to follow suit but tell me what it do for you?Except weigh you down now you trapped inside the cubiclethey built for us; the first step into change is to take noticeRealize the real games that they tried to show us300 plus years of them cold shouldersYet 300 million of us still got no focusSorry 'Merica but I will not be your soldierObama just wasn't enough, I just need some more closureAnd Donald Trump is not equipped to take this country overLet‰Ûªs face facts 'cause we know what's the real motivesWe can't change the world unless we change ourselvesDie from the sicknesses if we don't seek the healthAll eyes be my witness when I speak what's feltFull house on my hands, the cards I was dealtThree K's, two A's in AmeriKKKaI'm just a black spade spawn out the nebulaAnd everything I do is and say today is worthwhileWill for sure inspire action - hold up, yeah, uhTrickery in the system, put my niggas in prisonAll our history hidden, ain't no liberty givenWe all fit the description of what the documents writtenWe been lackin' the vision and barely makin' a livin'We too worried to fit in while they been benefitin'Every time you submittin', we all guilty, admit itThe Lord won't get you acquitted but you still ask for forgivenessPut opiates in syringes, then inject his religionHow many times I gotta tell you I'm a man on a mission?Many times I gotta tell you I don't need no permissionA human with super vision, ain't no livin' conditionI'm reachin' out to my children, just hopin' that they will listenStart a new coalition against corrupt politiciansIt's not enough pots to piss in, too many murder convictions'Nother family evicted, 'nother black man a victimThat's as real as it's gettin', you should take recognitionWe can't change the world unless we change ourselvesDie from the sicknesses if we don't seek the healthAll eyes be my witness when I speak what's feltFull house on my hands, the cards I was dealtThree K's, two A's in AmeriKKKaI'm just a black spade spawn out the nebulaAnd everything I do is and say today is worthwhileWill for sure inspire action in your first child, yeah
