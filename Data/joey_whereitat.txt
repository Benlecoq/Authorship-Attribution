Let's get down tonightI think I might blow a whole pound tonightSo shorty hit me with the spot and if it sound alrightThen you know I'm in the houseLet a nigga run his mouthIt's going down on sightI'm always down to fight[?] a nigga in the wild no bluffAin't no chuch when you're living in the wildI was hidden in the crowdRippin' on some loud'Till I seen the sucka nigga dick-lickin' on my styleWow must've been the material linenWhole night kept him in my peripheral visionAll I gotta say is the word and imperials get himWord to my pops I know niggas known for cereal killin'But back to the womenThey tryna catch me slippin'So I gotta pack a mags to stop venereal venomsFrom entering my systemIf it ain't my moms or my 'sistantI cut 'em in the systemYo let me tell you what I'm living likeSame shit just a different nightSuper bad chicks and they all up in my kryptonite'Bout to get downI'm tryna get up in the tightSo roll the endo rightAnd I can show you what them bitches likeThey just wanna come and have funTold this little hun she could comeBut don't touch my fundsI might get crazyI might bust a gunSo just give me some moneyAnd I might bust her sonMight bust and runThey said love will come knockin' at my doorWell I guess lust must've wrungThe dutch touch the lungs and it was onHad her beggin' for the dawn 'till the crack of dawnThen I passed it off to QuanI said it gotta be the swank if it ain't the rankCause some pull hoes like Hold upLet me pull ove'Told her to hop in then put it back and droveAnd hit it out park like Al Pujols
