Ever since I met ya I could beat depressionIt's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress yaI can see your state of misery from the introductionAin't bout no suckin and touchin, just harmless discussionMaybe we can see a better way, find a brighter dayLate night phone conversations -- would that be OK?I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in lineTell me your size, let me find you things with you in mindI can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare youBut anticipation of love makin got you shakin when I'm standin near youNews of precision will prepare yaIn case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirrorNow the picture's getten clearer all he does is hit you hardI tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in GodI don't understand, I just wanna bring ya homeI wonder should I leave you alone and find a woman of my ownAll the homies tell me that you don't deserve itI contemplate -- but in my heart I know you worth itTell me can you get away?Could it be my destiny to be lonely?And checkin for these hoochies that be on me cause they phonyBut you was different -- I got no need to be suspiciousCause I can tell -- my life with you would be deliciousThe way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addictedI'm sittin here hoping that we can find some way to kick itEven though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist itSlowly advance and miss my chance not to miss itYou blow me kisseswhen he ain't lookin, now your heart's tookenMy only wish is that you change your mind and he get shookWanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrowHoping I can take you through the pain and sorrowLet you know I care -- that someone's there for your struggleDepend on me, when you have needs or there's troubleI wanna give you happiness and maybe even moreI told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the storeCan you get away?I see you reminiscin and I hope you listeninIn the position to pressure and offer competitionMe and you -- was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonelyCause now it's on for you and me, all I can seeA happy home, that's my fantasyBut my reality is problems with your man and meWhat can I do?  Don't wanna lose you to the suckerCause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that bustaDon't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fastNobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I askI hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if youstay with him today I'm still hereI refuse to give up -- cause I believe in what we shareYou're livin in prison and what he's givin can't compareCause everything I feel for you I wanna let you knowPassionately yours and I'll never let you goTell me can you get away?
