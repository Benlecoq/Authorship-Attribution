Finally I'm on vacation and school is throughSo here I am, on Monday mornin' with nothin' to doTried to get outta my bed, but I can't moveYa see I'm stuck to my matress like crazy glueSo there I lay, for half the day just thinkin'Got up to brush my teeth cause my breath started stinkin'But I was all alone so it wasn't no thingGot up to take a shower and heard the phone ringPicked it up, the salutations, little bit frustrationsWho could be disturbin' me on my vacation?Speakin' on the phone in an aggravatin' toneNow I know what Michael meant by leave me aloneSo I'm askin' who is it? and the answer shocks meIt was the voice of my homeboy Roc-THim and Dizzy had been waitin' for meHad a show at three and now I'm late as can beSaid I have to take a shower, I'll go ahead and take it If I leave within the hour, I still might make itI'm rollin' in a sweatsuit, wasn't tryin' to get cuteHopped on to the stage and said: "Sorry that I kept you"I started rappin', girls started clappin'Couldn't wait to finish so I could start mackin'Jumped off stage, picked up the girl for the nightHuh, that's how I'm livin', a day in the life, come onA day in the lifeCoolin' with my posse at the neighborhood discoTalkin' to a cutie as I'm sippin' on my ciscoAskin' me to dance but I keep on sayin' "No"Hate to dance fast, I only like to do it slowDizzy's on the dance floor, funky, funky motionGirl keeps on sweatin' me with sexual kind of totionsRoc is signin' autographs makin' girlies dizzyCrowd sweatin' Strictly Dope cause we're gettin' busySuckers wanna battle us, we move in silenceStrictly Dope is positive, we're tryin' to stop the violenceStarted feel tipsy, I'm lookin' for the doorThe Cisco had me dizzy, I stumbled to the floorAnd more I try to sit up, the less I seem to get upMy stomach starts to turn and my head feels wit' upThe room begins to spin, I pass out for the nightJust another way of livin' a day in the life, kick it
