I know how it feel to wake up fucked upPockets broke as hell, another rock to sellPeople look at you like youse the userSelling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuserBut they don't know about your stress-filled dayBaby on the way mad bills to payThat's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisceand wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshitI remember I was just like youSmokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62'sCause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-GI got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate meShe was forced to kick me out, no doubtThen I figured out nicks went for twenty down SouthPacked up my tools for my raw power moveGlock nineteen for casket and flower movesfor chumps tryin to stop my flowAnd what they don't know will show on the autopsyWent to see Papi, to cop me a brickAsked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear itSmoking mad Newports cause I'm due in courtfor an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New YorkCatch me if you can like the Gingerbread ManYou better have your gat in hand, cause manI had the master planI'm in the caravan on my way to Marylandwith my man Two-Tecs to take over this projectsThey call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecsAnd when he start to bust he like to ask, "Who's next?"I got my honey on the Amtrakwith the crack in the crack of her assTwo pounds of hash in the stashI wait for hon to make some quick cashI told her she could be Lieutenant, bitch got gassedAt last, I'm literally loungin blackSittin back, countin double digit thousand stacksHad to re-up; see what's up with my peepsToyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the JeepsSee who got smoked, what rumors was spreadLast I heard I was dead with six to the headThen I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harderWe got infiltrated, like Nino at the CarterHeard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard ofby some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burnersAnd my bitch swear to God she won't snitchI told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker richConspiracy, she'll be home in threeUntil then I looks out for the whole familyA true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble;in the everyday struggleI'm seeing body after body and our mayor Guilianiain't tryin to see no black man turn to John GottiMy daughter use a potty so she's older nowEducated street knowledge I'ma mold 'er nowTrick a little dough buyin young girls fringesDealin with the dope fiend binges, seein syringesin the veins; hard to explain, how I maintainThe crack smoke make my brain feel so strangeBreakin days on the set, no sweatDrunk off Moet, can't bag yet because it's still wetBut when that dry, baggin five at a timeI can clock about nine on the check cashin lineI had the first and the third; rehearse that's my wordThick in the game, D's knew my first nameShould I quit? Shit no! Even though they had me scaredYo they got a eight, I gotta teck with air holes....and that's just how the shit go in the struggle motherfucker
