Now how can I explain how this game laced, plus with this fameI got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changedGot to the point where I was driven, twenty-four/sevenMoney's my mission, just a nigga tryin to make a livinThese busta tricks don't want no mailThey spendin they riches on skanless bitcheswho'll stay petrified in jailIt's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticketJealous-ass bitches, playa-hatin but we still kick itAlways keep my eyes on the prize, watch the policeSeen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin no sleepBut still, I get my money on major, continuouslyCommunicatin through my pager, niggaz know meDon't have no homies cause they jealous, I hustle soloCause when I'm broke I got no time for the fellas, listenAin't nothin poppin 'bout no work nigga, I ain't no jokeFuck what they say and get your dough niggaHeavy in the game I'm just a young black male, cursed since my birthHad to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worseHeaded for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearseMy only way to stack mail, is out here doin dirtMade my decisions do or die, been hustlin since junior highNo time for askin why, gettin high, gettin minePut away my nine, cause these times call for four-five salescause life is hell and everybody diesWhat about these niggaz I despise -- them loud talkin cowards shootin guns into crowds, jeapordizin livesShoot em right between them niggaz eyes, it's time to realizefollow the rules or follow them fools that dieEverybody's tryin to make the news, niggaz confusedQuit tryin to be an O.G. and pay your duesIf you choose to apply yourself, go with the grainand come the riches and the bitches and the fameHeavy in the game
