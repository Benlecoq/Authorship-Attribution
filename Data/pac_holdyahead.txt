I wake up early in the mornin, mindstate so militarySuckers fantasizin pictures of a young brother buriedWas it me, the weed, or this life I leadIf daytime is for suckers then tonight we breedOut for all that, knowin that this world bring drawbacksLook how this shit bump once I deliver these raw rapsMeet me at the cemetery dressed in blackTonight we, honor the dead, those who won't be backSo if I die, do the same for me, shed no tearsAn Outlaw, thug livin in this game for yearsWhy worry, hope to God, get me high when I'm buriedKnowin deep inside only a few love meCome rush me to the gates of heaven, let me picture for a whileHow I lived for my days as a child; I wonder nowHow do we outlast, always get cashStay strong if we all mash, hold ya headHahaha, yoThese felonies be like prophecies beggin me to stopCause these lawyers gettin money everytime they knock usSnatchin pockets lyrically, suckers flea when they noticeSwitched my name to Makaveli, half the rap game closedExposed foes with my hocus pocus flows they frozeNow suckers idolize my, chosen blowsAnd mo' money mean litigatin, mo' playa hatinGot a cell at the pen for me waitin - is this my fate?Miss me with that misdemeanor thinkin, me fall back?Never that, too much tequila drinkin, we all thatMake them understand me, if not I slang my posseEveryone with me is family, cause everybody's got meWatch me paint a perfect vision, this life we livingot us all meetin up in prison..Last week I got a letter from my road dog, written in bloodSaying, "Please show a playa love" - hold ya head!Hold itThe weed got me tweakin in my mind, I'm thinkin..God bless the child that can hold his ownIndeed, enemies bleed when I hold my chromeLet these words be the last to my unborn seedsHope to raise my young nation in this world of greedCurrency means nothin if you still ain't freeMoney breeds jealousy, take the game from meI hope for better days, trouble comes naturallyRunning from authorities 'til they capture meAnd my, aim is to spread mo' smiles than tearsUtilalize lessons learned from my childhood yearsMaybe Mama had it all right, rest yo' headTradin converstion all night, bless the deadTo the homies that I used to have that no longer rollCatch a brother at the crossroads..Plus nobody knows my soul, watchin time passThrough the glass of my drop-top Rolls, hold ya head!
