So gullible just like my first loveStay humble, but I knew that I was first upPicked up the pen and that's when I drew my first bloodSpit my heart again, cause the pain'll never endHappiness is temporary, always has beenI just lost one, but sometimes I winI always spread love, but sometimes I sinI only trust some, that's why I keep a few friendsFunny cause I used to see my circle never endAlways kept like 47 friends in my circumferenceAll that's left now is the radianceThey still here, trying to find love on this atmosphereThings get severe for everybody, everywhereThis is my moment of truth, right hereSwear I ain't scared of no manI see the omensI pick 'em up and keep it rollin'The omnipresence is omnipotentBut I keep going, 'til it's all said and doneI show all my soul purpose but I'm pretty sure there's oneThere's a reason why I've come, new season's just begunThis the death of a psychopomp but a birth of God's sonI had a dream I seen my name on the gravel stoneAnd read here lies a G followed by a poemI couldn't see the words but I'm sure what's in his ownFunny that I write most when I know my feeling's wrongWith both shoulders that my head is always onI trudge through harm's way with heavy boulders on my armI feel strong as I walk through the many storms thatRain on my parade, seen the dust cry for daysI'm feeling like a young prince, I'm drinking todayMy name ring bells all the way to heaven's gateThough STEEZy told about me, yo I know he always watchingI guess there really is a heaven for us hip hoppersI really miss my partnerBut I know he with Big Poppa, 2 Pacs, and the big L rolled properAnd that's a big pun, know that I'mma join himWhen my time come, but the story just begun, so
