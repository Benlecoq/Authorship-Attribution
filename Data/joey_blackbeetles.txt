And I guess we them little black beetlesJust want attractive singlesAnd that flow is mean, but it lacks tacs and needlesI spend my days sharpening my skill wills while it's still legalWeeding through cathedrals applied to my cerebralThey ain't built they feeble, driven by the egoThe vision of a eagle, see the vision in my peopleHow many lives will they take today? We ain't equalAnother world where it's sequel a doomsday prequelThis ain't the world we thought it was when we as in pre-schoolSometimes it's hard to be cool, sometimes I feel like I'm see-thruSometimes I really wish, yo I wish that I could be youAway from all the Hollywood acts and record contractsI won't say I take it back, because I worked hard for thatBut this life ain't turn out to be what it seemEver since I woke up I been living in a dreamGot meWho would've thought a marchin' Martin could spark a starvin' artistSpit art, at heart young Marcus GarveyPonders on it, hardly, rap wonders fondlySmoking herb with just Marley and meThis one is for my dogs barking up on the treeSometimes that wind blows eventually she gon leave, that's mother nature for yaUh, patient it's sagacious I ain't gon pay shit why she ain't gon say shitNow that's respectable cause most women expect it thoExcept that the words are derived through the rhythm wreck em'Professional, exceptional, half man half extra terrestrial
