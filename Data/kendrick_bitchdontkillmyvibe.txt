Uh, look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get richLook inside of your soul and you can find out it never existI can feel the changes, I can feel a new lifeI always knew life can be dangerous; I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless, you don't know what pain isHow can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with youFell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake living deep in my heartWear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yoursWhy you resent every making of this, tell me your purpose is petty againBut even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridgeI'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we loveYou're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio doesAnd I'm looking right past you; we live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles; you live in a world, you living behind the mirrorI know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferiorThis shit is vital, I know you had to; this shit is vital, I know you had toTo die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believableGive me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name; I'll let the people know this is something you can blame on yourselves you can remain, stuck in a boxI'mma break out and then hide every lock, I'mma break out and then hide every lock
