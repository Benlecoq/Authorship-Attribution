As real as it seems the American DreamAin't nothing but another calculated schemesTo get us locked up shot up back in chainsTo deny us of the future rob our namesKept my history of mystery but now I seeThe American Dream wasn't meant for meCause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to mePromised me freedom, education, equalityNever gave me nothing but slaveryAnd now look at how dangerous you made meCalling me a mad man cause I'm strong and boldWith this dump full of knowledge of the lies you toldPromise me emancipation indispute nationAll you gave my people was our patienceFathers of our country never cared for meThey kept my answer shackled up in slaveryAnd Uncle Sam never did a dam thing for meExcept lie about the facts in my historySo now I'm sitting hear mad cause I'm unemployedBut the government's glad cause they enjoyedWhen my people are down so they can screw us aroundTime to change the government now panther powerMy Mother never let me forget my historyHoping I was set free chains never put on meWanted to be more than just freeHad to know the true facts about my historyI couldn't settle for being a statisticCouldn't survive in this capitalisticGovernment cause it was meant to hold us backUsing ignorant, drugs, to sneak attackIn my community think of unityBut when I charged them, tried to claim immunityI strike America like a case of hard diseasePanther power is running through my arteriesTry to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to deathCause I'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breathDo you remember that is what I'm asking you?You think you living free don't let me laugh at youOpen your eyes realize that you have been locked in chainsSaid you wasn't civilized and stole your nameCause some time has passed seem you all forgetThere ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yetPanter powerAs real as it seems the American DreamAin't nothing but another calculated schemesTo get us locked up shot up back in chainsTo deny us of the future rob our namesKept my history of mystery but now I seeThe American Dream wasn't meant for meCause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to mePromised me freedom, education, equalityNever gave me nothing but slaveryAnd now look at how dangerous you made meCalling me a mad man cause I'm strong and boldWith this dump full of knowledge of the lies you toldPromise me emancipation indispute nationAll you gave my people was our patienceFathers of our country never cared for meThey kept my answer shackled up in slaveryAnd Uncle Sam never did a dam thing for meExcept lie about the facts in my historySo now I'm sitting hear mad cause I'm unemployedBut the government's glad cause they enjoyedWhen my people are down so they can screw us aroundTime to change the government now panther power
