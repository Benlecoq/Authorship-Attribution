I met her at this house party on El Segundo and CentralShe had the credentials of strippers in AtlantaAss came with a hump from the jump, she was a camelI want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz"Hello my name is Kendrick" she said "No, you're handsome"Whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancin'Ciara had played in the backgroundThe parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now (cool)"Where you stay?" She said "Down the street from Dominguez High"Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount; "Well is it Compton?""No" she replied and quickly start battin' her eyes andI strictly had wanted her thighs around meSeventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mentalMy motive was rather sinful, "What you tryna get into?"She didn't tell, just gave me her NextelDropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and wellThe summer had passed and now I'm likin' herConversation we having probably enticin' herWho could imagine? Maybe my actions would end up wifin' herLove or lust, regardless we'll fuck cause the trife in usIt's deep rooted, the music of bein' young and dumbIt's never muted, in fact it's much louder where I'm fromWe know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addictShe live with her granny and her younger two brothersHer favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetibleFamily history of gangbangin' did make me skepticalBut not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut"I wanna come over, what's up?" That's what I told her soon as this episode of "Martin" go off, I'm tryin' to get offI was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of bein' thirstyProbably could hurt me, but fuck it I got some heartGrab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boySo now I'm down Rosecrans in a CaravanPassin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pumpI got enough to get me through the traffic jamAt least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise manI'm thinkin' bout that sex - thinkin' bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what positions nextSent a picture of her titties blowin' up my textsI looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into CorvetteEnthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuseAnd I'm a professional porn star when off the GooseI had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransomI'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthemI'm two blocks away, 250 feetAnd six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the streetI pulled up a smile on my face, and then I seeTwo niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang
