Uh, motherfuckin' microphone checkerKeep that grip tight, like my Smith & WessonIke with the mic, which nigga tryna turn up?Hit you with the hurtful fuckin' truth, like SojournerMotherfuckin' microphone eaterSpittin' hot shit, hit ya dome with the heaterWouldn't want to be ya, dish lyrical fajitasGot dragon balls, like my name was VegetaMotherfuckin' super duper swankin'Niggas still hatin', pigs want him for the baconTake 'em to the slaughterhouse, say we 'bout to order outTell 'em we the badass motherfuckers that they heard aboutYes, I guess the word is out, we comin' for the top dollarTop rottweiler, since I popped my collarNiggas say they hit us, they ain't ever shot nadaMe? I'd rather not snitch up on my own problemsCause I'm a microphone killerEspecially when my head is gone off the liquorSpecially educated, heavily medicatedGive me that beat and I'll put you next to Dilla, my niggaFlow sweeter than vanillaTell these haters beat it, can't Jackson thrillerI'm the nigga that you see when you're in the mirrorSay my name five times, this what I deliver
