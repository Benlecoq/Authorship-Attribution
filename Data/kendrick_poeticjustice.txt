I recognize your fragrance You ain't never gotta say shit And I know your taste isA little bit (mmm) high maintenanceEverybody else basicYou live life on an everyday basisWith poetic justice, poetic justiceIf I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to youAnd you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my penBetter yet when your friends and themI really wanna know you allI really wanna show you offFuck that, pour up plenty of champagneCold nights when you curse this nameYou called up your girlfriends andY'all curled in that little bitty range I heard thatShe wanna go and party, She wanna go and partyNigga don't approach her with that AtariNigga that ain't good game, homie, sorryThey say conversation, rule a nation, I can tellBut I can never right my wrongs'less I write it down for real, P.SEvery time I write these words they become a tabooMaking sure my punctuation curveEvery letter is trueLiving my life in the margin and that metaphor was proofI'm talking poetic justice, poetic justiceIf I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?I mean you need to hear thisLove is not just a verb, It's you looking in the mirrorLove is not just a verb, It's you looking poor maybeCall me crazy, We can both be insaneA fatal attraction is commonAnd what we have common is painI mean you need to hear thisLove is not just a verb and I can see power steeringSex drive when you swerve, I want that interferenceIt's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmmThat's your heartbeatIt either caught me or it called me, mmhmmBreathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these linesSincerely, yours trulyAnd right before you go blindP.S.....
