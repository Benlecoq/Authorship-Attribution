Yo, with not a damn thing on my mindBut this rhyme, in a matter of timeTo make this whole shit allignLike I planned out, nothing in life gets handoutJust stand out, ever since I had to pop my fish and panned outPressure board 'til I'm fanned outNow we the pop off the bandSo they can't keep their hands off of the man nowDivide their man, give 'em that S vitaminBaby Cham styleGots a Trini girl to soak it up, ShamWoW!Damn child, you're killin 'emFillin' 'em, drillin' 'em with serums, of pure adrenalineHigh blood feelin' like the thermostat cracked left mercury spillin'Your favorite rapper tryna earn stacks from nursery childrenTrue emcees write their verse and rehearse it a million timesJust for the rebirth of the feelin' prime and goldenShawty ask what I'm holdin', teasin' 'emKnowing the magnum blast squeeze magnesiumUsed to be mad premature now I'm at premiumFrom lookin' up to niggas, to lookin' up niggas meetin' 'emMeetings with 'em, give 'em a high pitch like curveballs and heliumYoung scorcher trying to evolve like CharmeleonMillion, yeah nigga, just tryna get a millionGot the bomb nigga, Baghdad, I'm blown away from a bad passWalk on grass, blow skunk, Ishamael so funk in the stashMy SB's, enter money I never hadI was more authentic, vaporize when I got heatedNever jealous, solid as a rock n' roll full plateNo po' peddlers, just some Pro fellasWho you know better? Never lost my groove I don't know no StellaIt's a cold world without CoachellaA shady bunch, like under Interscope umbrellaBut that don't phase me once, people say I'm crazy butCall me young Evel cause I crazy stuntI mace these punks, drop swank like it's knowledge to yaMr. Bada$$ is the scholar's tutorsSwank the lord and hallelujahStill praying to the allahs, gods and judahsBalance out my lows on the low highNiggas ain't know I sit so highBalance out my lows on the low highI'm like a low high
