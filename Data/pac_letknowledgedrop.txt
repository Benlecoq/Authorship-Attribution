Let knowledge dropWhy should I be forced to play dumb?I know where I came from so I'm going to claim someBut rocking to the top where the cream of the cropSuckers calling the cops but they can come and get droppedStop think of the past the brothers that die forSucker to try for never to cry moreTricks to hold his back but we'll see at the endHe's a fake not a friendSo he's thinking of when he can backstab grab or go your holeYo he's a trick so he sold his soul for goldNow I know the reason we must excelCause if we don't we'll end up in the cellMove on be strong with unityCause that's the only way to build communitiesLies are told but yo lives must move onAnd never stop open your mind to this rhyme and let it dropSuckers suffocate when I hype this because you can write thisYou constantly bite thisThought that you could get me but you sweating me too closeCaught with the dope doseNow suckers get toast wondering who you tossedCause you building a boom forceLike what you hearing so your checking with the sourceTupac brother with the rhymes to rock onDizzy gets busy by putting beats to drop onAmateurs get damaged if you try to attack meSuckers get jealous cause the girls get at meI'm not conceited but defeated I won't beAs long as there's dope beats I'll never be lonely stopAnd let me breathe a minuteAiyyo Dizzy what's up put the base back in it
