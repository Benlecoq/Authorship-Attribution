Young black maleI try to effect by kicking the factsand stacking much mailI'm packing a gat cuz guys wanna jackand fuck goin to jailCause I ain't a crook, despite how I lookI don't sell llelloThey're judging a brother like covers and booksFollow me into a flowI'm sure you know, which way to goI'm hittin em out of the dopesSo slip on the slope, let's skip on the flowI'm fuckin the sluts and hoesThe bigger the butts the tighter the clothesThe gimminy jimminy growsThen whaddya know, it's off with some clothesI love when the crowd says, "Ho!"That let's me know, they know I can flowLove when they come to my showsI get up and go, with skins beforeWhen I'm collecting my doughI never respect, the one that I backThe quicker the nigga can rapThe bigger the check, now watch how they sweatWhat kind of style is that?The style of a mack, and ready to jackI rendered up piles of blackThe wacker the pack, the fatter the smackI hate it when real nigga bustThey hate when I cuss, they threaten to bustI had enough of the fussI bust what I bust, and cuss when I mustThey gave me a charge for salesFor selling the tales... of young black males
